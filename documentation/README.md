## 📊 Sample Interview Transcript

```
🤖 AI Interviewer: Hello! I'm your AI Excel interviewer. I'll be conducting a mock interview to assess your Excel proficiency. The interview will take about 15-20 minutes and cover various Excel topics from basic functions to advanced features.

👤 Candidate: Hi! I'm Sarah. I've been using Excel for about 3 years, mostly for financial analysis and reporting. I'd say I'm at an intermediate level.

🤖 AI Interviewer: Great to meet you, Sarah! Based on your experience with financial analysis, I can see you have solid Excel foundations. Let's start with a question that relates to your work: Can you explain the difference between SUM and SUMIF functions? When would you use each?

👤 Candidate: SUM adds up all values in a range, while SUMIF adds values based on a condition. For example, SUM(A1:A10) adds everything, but SUMIF(B1:B10,"Sales",A1:A10) only adds values where column B equals "Sales". I use SUMIF a lot for monthly reports to sum revenue by category.

🤖 AI Interviewer: Excellent explanation! You clearly understand both functions and provided a practical example from your work. Now, let's move to a more advanced scenario: How would you handle a lookup situation where you need to find the second occurrence of a value in a list?

👤 Candidate: That's tricky! I'd probably use INDEX and MATCH with a helper column or array formula. Actually, I think XLOOKUP might have options for multiple matches, but I'm not as familiar with that function yet.

🤖 AI Interviewer: Good thinking! You're right that INDEX/MATCH is one approach, and XLOOKUP does have multiple match capabilities. Your problem-solving approach shows strong analytical thinking.

[Interview continues with 3 more questions...]

🤖 AI Interviewer: Thank you for completing the Excel interview! I'll now prepare a detailed feedback report for you.

📊 Final Report:
- Overall Performance: Good (75%)
- Strengths: Strong practical application, clear communication
- Areas for Improvement: Advanced lookup functions, array formulas
- Recommendations: Practice with XLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH combinations
```
